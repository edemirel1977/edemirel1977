I study on the development of computational models for the CFD simulation of engineering problems. My projects are: 
- Development of an implicitly coupled density based solver for the simulation of high speed flows over aircrafts. 
- Development of a roboust and fast solver for the flow and thermal simulations of data centers in the scope of ECO-QUBE https://www.eco-qube.eu/project founded by European Commision.
