I study on the development of computational models for the CFD simulation of engineering problems with parallel computing on HPC. 
# Personal and community Projects
- Development of an implicitly coupled density based solver for the simulation of high speed flows over aircrafts. 
- Development of a roboust and fast solver for the flow and thermal simulations of data centers in the scope of ECO-QUBE project https://www.eco-qube.eu founded by European Commision.   
- Development of a computational model for the simulation of laminar flows over complex boundaries using a ghost-cell immersed boundary method
